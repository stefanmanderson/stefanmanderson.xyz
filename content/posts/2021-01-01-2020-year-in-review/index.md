*2020*. 

It was a tough year. Many of us lose our friends, families, and the ones that we love. This COVID-19 changed our life and also our behavior. 2020 taught me a lot about how to face this tough life. Here are some achievements that I made in 2020.

I read 3 books.

I woke up at 5.30 am every day for 2 months.

I started to run 3 km every day for 2 months and lost 4 kg.

I started to learn CFA level 1 preparation material.

I started to learn Python and SQL.

I started to journal.

It looks productive, right? Yeah, but it only happened for 2 months. After that, I went back to my old routine. I stopped learning the CFA materials because, in my opinion, later on, Artificial Intelligence (AI) will replace the financial analyst position. So, I should learn Data Science instead. I tried to learn Python and SQL for 3 months, but I didn't really like it.

My brother said that I have a good understanding of finance and should develop more about my finance skill. I realized that I'm in my quarter-life crisis. I am not really sure about what I should do in the future. It really sucked! I felt stressed for about 2-3 months, wondering what I should do for a living after I finish my study. How can I overcome my stress? Just find a thing that you really love the most, and don't forget to put your heart into it.

From that moment on, I promised myself to learn more about finance, which should work. However, finance is comprehensive. I think I should be more specific in finance. I was really interested in capital markets since I've done my undergraduate thesis deeply related to analyzing a company's financial reports, strengths and weaknesses, and market issues. This has allowed me to predict corporate bankruptcy. So, being an investment analyst or equity research seems like a lot of fun! 

I am also currently taking a Financial Modelling and Valuation Analyst (FMVA) course from Corporate Finance Institute (CFI) to further improve and develop my skill and knowledge. The FMVA course will improve my analyzing a company's financial performance, valuation, and financial modeling. Besides learning, I also want to teach the things that I have learned to others. That's why in 2021, I am planning to make videos and write about finance and economics. I hope my videos and writings can help people to understand finance better. Letâ€™s learn together!
