2021 has been an amazing year so far. I graduated from Universitas Katolik Parahyangan, Bandung. It’s been a tough, fun, and wild year surviving during my team in college. Things I really grateful for:

- Having a supportive family.
- Having someone who has paid my college tuition fee since the 3rd semester at UNPAR. 
- Having Ibu Tan who has guided me to finish my undergraduate thesis.
- Having a good community during my college period.
- Having a good experience during my internship at Blibli.com and Astra Credit Companies.

It’s just fascinating to know that God always takes care of me all the time. Last February or maybe at the end of January 2021, I applied to The Complete Banker Program in CIMB Niaga. I was worried that the company didn’t respond to my application. But after 4-5 days of waiting, finally, I got the invitation email for the psychological test. After I submitted my result, one of the HR called me and informed me that I passed the psychological test. Long short story, I finally joined The Complete Banker in CIMB Niaga Batch 23. February has been an amazing month for me because it is the first time I got a job interview and also I finally graduated from Universitas Katolik Parahyangan.

Thanks to all my family and friends who always support me since day one. Hope you guys have a good day!
